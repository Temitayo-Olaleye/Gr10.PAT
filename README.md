# Gr10.PAT
Program made for my Grade 10 school PAT. It is an educational mathematics games designed for children.
• In this game you'll have to answer the maths equations in the space provided
• Each time you successfully answer a question you will advance towards the finish line
• Be careful! An evil robot is also answering questions. If they reach it first, or the timer runs out, you lose!
• Your goal IS to reach the finish line before the robot
Good Luck!
